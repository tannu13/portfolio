		<p>Learning something new excites me, mainly about Web Technologies. Am awakened by a colleague of mine to this amazing world of web and the ever new spurting technologies in the wake. The more I learn the more I realize that I have miles to go before I could rest. So I thought let's start walking. This is my first stab at HTML &amp; CSS.</p>
		<p>Love playing table tennis with friends or colleagues. Love to beat the ones that are equal or better than me, when I have my better days. But I am also a fan of Naruto, DBZ, One Piece and let's stop here and I am not 10.</p>
